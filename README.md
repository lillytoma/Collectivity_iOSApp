# Collectivity

*(On Test Flight)*

A personal growth application designed to strengthen communities by developing individual skills in empathy, communication, self-awareness, and gratitude. Collectivity transforms personal development into meaningful community impact through guided daily practice and skill-building activities.


## How to Use Collectivity

Collectivity is a community focused personal growth application. Users engage with thoughtful prompts for gratitude, empathy building exercises, communication challenges, and self-awareness activities that translate directly into stronger community connections. Through voice reflections, progress tracking, and skill based badges, Collectivity helps users develop the emotional intelligence and social skills that every thriving community needs. By focusing on individual growth that creates collective impact, the app bridges personal development with meaningful social change.

## Development Journey

This repository documents our team's process of building Collectivity at Apple Developer Academy. Born from personal questioning about community disconnection, we discovered that stronger communities start with individuals who develop essential people skills. Our team combined diverse expertise: project management, full-stack development, and user experience design. We created an application that addresses the gap between personal growth and community impact. Throughout development, we've conducted user research to ensure our approach resonates with people experiencing community disconnection. This project represents our commitment to using technology as a bridge between individual development and collective flourishing.
